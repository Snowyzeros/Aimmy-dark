Dark Mode for Aimmy
---------------------
Aimmy-Dark's interface is designed with a complete dark mode for a sleek and modern look.

Aimmy-Dark is the normal version of Aimmy. The only modifications made were to the colors of the UI.
All credits for the application goes to BabyHamsta, MarsInsanity & Taylor.

Information:


Buttons, menus, and all elements match the dark theme.


Reduces eye strain I guess


Looks great with the matte black UI
